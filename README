Bringing common kernel APIs into Ruby using FFI.

I plan to support the following kernel APIs:

kqueue (works - see tests/test_kqueue.rb)
epoll (works - see tests/test_epoll.rb)
inotify
netlink

and maybe some others!

I will at first hook up the C interfaces as directly as possible, and eventually write 
Rubyist-friendly wrappers around them.

Build system is currently a mess so bear with me while I make a real one.
